This layer modifies Yocto/Poky's core-image-base
to build a remote agent for controlling
my Elecraft K3 transceiver.  See the layer readme
for important information on correctly configuring
this layer.

Mount the remote SMB volume as follows:
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=chris,rw,uid=chris,gid=chris  //pi-k3remote/sandbox-pik3 /media/mnt/

Built against kirkstone and core-image-base.

To build the SDK w/ QT support, build these targets in this order:
$ bibake core-image-base
$ bitbake meta-toolchain-qt5
Do not use -c populate_sdk against your image to build the SDK
See: https://embeddeduse.com/2020/06/19/qt-embedded-systems-2-build-qt-sdk-with-yocto/

Once this image is built, as it is currently configured, samba server must be manually configured using the following command on the target:
$ sudo smbpasswd -a chris
